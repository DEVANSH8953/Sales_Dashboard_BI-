# Sales_Dashboard_BI
In this data-driven project, unstructured data from Excel was seamlessly integrated into Power BI, marking the inception of a comprehensive Super Sales Dashboard. The data underwent meticulous cleaning, encompassing validation checks for data types and random value scrutiny. Following the preparation phase, a visually captivating background was curated, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal.

Key components of the dashboard were strategically crafted using filters and slicers, facilitating a dynamic user experience. The focal points included the derivation of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, profit, total quantity sold, and average delivery time. The latter was achieved through the implementation of Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), where a new column named 'avgdelivery time' was formulated using syntactical precision.

Moreover, the project incorporated advanced forecasting techniques to predict sales trends for the upcoming 15 days. This involved the utilization of line charts and leveraging the forecast tool embedded in Power BI. Notably, the forecasting accuracy was validated, underscoring the effectiveness of the predictive modeling employed.

This endeavor underscores the seamless integration of data science and data analytics methodologies within Power BI, resulting in an intuitive and actionable Super Sales Dashboard that empowers stakeholders with insights for informed decision-making.In this data-driven project, unstructured data from Excel was seamlessly integrated into Power BI, marking the inception of a comprehensive Super Sales Dashboard.
